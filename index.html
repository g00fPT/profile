            <p style="font-style: italic;">Code cadet and future Full Stack Developer</p>
            <p class="profile-txt">I am a self taught Web Developer. I wrote my first ever line of code in February of
                2020. From there
                I
                started learning the basics of HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.</p>

            <p>March 15, 2020 - The day I decided to do whatever it takes to become a Developer</p>

                <h3>HTML 5</h3>
                <p>My HTML level is intermediate. I understand the sintax and the advantages/disadvantages of using HTML in order to format your website.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>CSS 3</h3>
                <p>Working with CSS is actually more complex than I imagined before actually doing it. My first experience with CSS was back in the time I used Adobe Dreamweaver in college to make my very first website.
                    At that time I thought I totally dominated CSS.(Sweet innocent Fabio...)

                <h3>Javascript</h3>
                <p>As I got to know the basics of webdevelopment, regarding the basics of frontend and backend languages I decided to go for Javascript.
                   Since the beggining of March 2020 I have been learning this language alongside with HTML and CSS. I have developed a few JS projects that you will be able to see in my Portfolio.

                <h3>JAVA</h3>
                <p>Java is the first language I decided to learn before I even knew what I was doing. My level regarding the development is quite basic but I understand the sintax of the language.</p>

                <h3>Microsoft Office</h3>
                <p>I have been working with MS Office tools for years. 
                    Being a very curious user allowed me to explore most functionalities in Word, Excel, Powerpoint and Outlook, wich I use in a daily basis in my current job.
                    I can also use Access and Publisher but there are better tools out there.</p>
